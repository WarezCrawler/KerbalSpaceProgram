That's good, but it's easy, we're going to go over a more complex procedure today, getting to another planet directly from a low Kerbin orbit. The difficulty of the task depends a lot on the planet you intend to visit. One obvious reason is that farther Celestial Bodies need more dV to be reached, but you also have to take the CB's characteristics into account, such as atmosphere, gravity and the like. \n\nSo when choosing a planet to visit your first stop should be the Tracking Station's Knowledge Base.

Well, think about your orbit as a hill for a moment, if you're going uphill it's harder than going downhill, right? This is because your kinetic energy is lower when you're traveling to a higher point, so going back to orbits the point of highest kinetic energy of the orbit is the Periapsis, because it's where you're about to change from downhill to uphill.\n\nYou may ask yourself what all this has to do with getting to Duna, well back to the hill analogy, you get tired less if you run downhill, you use less energy, it's the same here, you burn less fuel if your kinetic energy is at its highest.", expandW: false, expandH: true), new DialogGUIButton("Next", delegate

Outside of training I recommend you speed up time in the Tracking Station if you don't want to wait that long. But how do you know exactly how long you have to wait? Well, that's complicated. The simplest way to guide you is with something called phase angles between the Kerbin and the CB you want to go to taking the Sun as reference. The phase angle to use on Duna is about 45 degrees.
